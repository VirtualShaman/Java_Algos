Save The World:
The apocalypse finally happened. There was a massive outbreak, a pandemic with no cure. 
The world has been torn apart, cities crumbled to the ground, no hope for mankind in sight. 
After 3 years of surviving you find yourself and your group traveling towards a small town somewhere 
in the MidWest. On the side of the road lay a dying man. Your group tries to help him but the 
sickness has taken over and he only has moments left. With his last words he tells you that there is a cure.
"In the tall building at the end of the road, on the 6th floor, at the end of the hall, there is a room 
with a digital scale and a cabinet. Inside the cabinet are 20 pill bottles, each bottle containing 20 pills each. One bottle contains the cure, the pills in that bottle weigh 1.01 grams each. The rest of 
the bottles contain pills that weigh 1 gram each and when consumed will kill you. The scale in the room 
works but it only has enough battery life to weigh something once. It will give you one reading then it 
will die...". Your group sets forth to the breakout room of your choice to save the world.


For the first bottle you take one pill and for each bottle there after you take one more pill than the bottle before. the weight will show which pill bottle it came from based on the value of the decimal.

Apples and Oranges:
There are three boxes, one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. 
The boxes have been incorrectly labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of its box. 
Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. 
By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?
