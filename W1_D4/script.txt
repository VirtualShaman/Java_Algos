Catch Up Day Logic Puzzle 1
A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures, each containing an identical light bulb or light globe. 
Each light is connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched off at present. 
You are outside the room, and the door is closed. Before opening the door you may play around with the light switches
as many times as you like. But once you've opened the door, you may no longer touch a switch. After this, you go into 
the room and examine the lights. How can you tell which switch goes to which light?


Turn on 2. Wait for the bulb to get hot and turn off one. Go in and check the hot one first.
